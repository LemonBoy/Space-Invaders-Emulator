OMGALIENZATEMYLEM0N aka Space Invaders Emulator

Coded by The Lemon Man (aka lem0nboy) (2010)

To put it plainly features my Intel 8080 emu
written from scratch, some Space Invaders specific
hardware and a video interface using SDL.

Thanks to:
- Intel for making the 8080 and making the docs available
- Emutalk forum for docs
- #hackerchannel on freenode for everything else
